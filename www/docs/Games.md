We list games here and described links to sites that have more games applicable to play in elderly communities. 

## Petanque

Players or teams play their boules towards a smaller target ball. The aim of the game is to be the first player/team to score thirteen points. Points are scored by having one or more of your boules closer to the target than those of your opponent, after all boules have been thrown.

* **Number of participants** 2 - 6 
* **Duration** Variable, until one of the teams scores 13 points. 
* **Outdoor** (parks, hard dirt or gravel) 

The surface of a Petanque pitch can be of any material but thin gravel or sand is most appropriate. The shape can be either a thin strip 25 30 m long and 3 m wide or it can just be a large flat area. 
The player who starts the leg must first draw a circle around her feet with a diameter of between 35 and 50 cm. All players must keep both feet on the ground and within this circle when throwing. The nearest boule to the cochonnet is always called the "best boule". Each player throws boules until that player runs out of boules or throws a boule that is best boule. Once a player achieves best boule, the next player on the opponent team plays in the same way. When a player runs out of boules, the next player in the same team takes over. When all the players in a team run out of boules, the opposing team finishes the leg by playing all their remaining boules in an effort to increase their score. The winner of the leg scores one point for each boule that is closer to the target than the opponent's best boule. The team that reaches 13 points first, wins.

We place all the group of participants together in the room or space that we have prepared. One moderator with a few prepared questions explains the game and announces the question. For example: Would you prefer beach or mountain? The group have to divide depending on the answer, to the left side or to the right side. And like that with the other questions.
