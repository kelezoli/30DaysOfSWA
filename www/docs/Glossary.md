### 180° / 360°
Used to describe the viewable panorama in a VR application e.g. only in front of or around the user. 
### 3D
Meaning three-dimensional for example a box with width length and height. 
### 3D-Models
Digital objects defined by geometry materials and animations. 
### 3D-Printing
The construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD-Model or a digital 3D-Model.
### AR/VR
See Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality respectively.
### Assistance Systems
Digital assistance aims at support- ing users in all possible situations via intelligent and adaptive technologies. 
### Augmented Reality 
Overlaying the visible natural world with a layer of digital content which happens in real-time is correctly aligned with the real world and is interactive.
### Authoring Tools
Tools that help authors of content create material, e.g. for the use in AR/VR. Authoring tools work on an abstract, user friendly layer which compensates the IT and 3D expertise normally needed to create AR/VR content. 
### Avatar
The virtual representation of an user in a virtual environment most relevant for aspects of immersion and presence as well as social AR/ VR settings.
### Building Information Modelling
Process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. 
### Classroom-based Teaching / Learning
Is held at a set time and place, and is conducted by an instructor in an organized manner utilizing a lesson plan. 
### Collaborative Learning
A situation in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together. 
### Communication Skills
The knowledge of effective and appropriate communication patterns and the ability to use and adapt that knowledge in various contexts. 
### Computer-aided Design  (CAD)
The use of computers to aid in the creation modification analysis or optimization of a design.
### Controller
Input devices used for manipulating and/or interacting with virtual objects and environments.
### Degrees of Freedom (DoF)
The number of ways an object or user can move in a 3D space. The first three degrees refer to the rotational movement  whereas the addition of another three degrees refers to translational movements .
### Digital Twin
A virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. 
### Empathy Learning
Learning to cultivate empathy . 
### Employability Skills
The skills which enable people to gain, keep and progress in employment, including skills in the clusters of work readiness and work habits, interpersonal skills and learning, thinking and adaptability skills. 
### Game-based Learning 
Game based learning is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Through experimentation, learners actively learn and practice the right way to do things. 
### Gamification
The combination of immersive learning media and game-based learning offers particular potential because the emotional involvement and motivation of learners receive an additional boost. This is especially true of younger target groups. 
### Haptic Feedback
Haptic technology simulating the sense of touch for example through the sensation of pressure.
### Head-Mounted-Display (HMD)
 A set of goggles or a helmet with tiny high-resolution monitors in front of each eye to generate images that the viewer perceives as three-dimensional.
### Immersion
A perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. This is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. 
### Immersive Media
Media which allows users to reach a state of immersion in computer generated environments. The world thus technically constructed is then perceived as being real to a greater or lesser extent. 
### Industry 4.0
Combines production methods with state-of-the-art information and communications technology that allows to manufacture products based on the individual needs of customers. 
### Inside-out
A method of tracking commonly used in VR specifically for tracking the position of head-mounted displays and accessories where the camera or sensors are located on the device being tracked.
### Instructor 2.0 
An expert having skills to create install administer VR/AR environments and helps to make bridges between curriculum, teaching strategies and technology.
### Interaction Skills
The general ability to interact with the external world to accomplish a task. A typical interactive task requires the person to look for relevant information and choose the right actions. 
### Learning Objectives 
Learning goals in the area of feelings, attitudes and values. They are trained via reflection, networking and practical application 
### Learning Scenario
An instructional design model for a given subject and a given kind of situation that defines what learners and other actors should/can do with a given set of resources and tools.
### Metaverse
In science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal, and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. In everyday usage, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.
### Mixed Reality
A spectrum ranging from real to virtual environments where augmented and virtual reality can be located on. 
### Motion Sickness
A very small proportion of users develop symptoms such as dizziness comparable to sea sickness. This problem has been alleviated thanks to advances in display-technology and optimized software.
### Motor Skills
Relationship between cognitive functions and physical movement, as demonstrated by fine or gross motor skills and the learning of coordinated activities.
### PC-based VR
Virtual Reality using a – generally powerful – computer. 
### Photogrammetry 
Photogrammetry is a measuring technology for obtaining information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiation.
### Professional 
Competencies Expert skill/knowledge in a particular field. The proven or demonstrated individual capacity to use know-how, skills, qualifications or knowledge in order to meet the usual, and changing, occupational situations and requirements. 
### Room-scale
A tracking paradigm that allows users to move freely within a room- sized AR/VR environment.
### Serious Game
A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. 
### Simulation
The imitation of a situation or a process. 
### Social Competencies
Social, emotional, cognitive and behavioral skills needed for successful social adaptation.
### Standalone VR
A HMD with built-in computing capabilities Inside-Out-Tracking and batteries allowing for wireless AR/VR experiences. 
### STEM
