To select the right immersive educational solution, you need to be aware of some technological aspects. First, you should have a close look at the hardware. Simulations differ in the system that tracks human motions, then digitalizes them and transfers signals to the screen or the oculars. These differences are very important when you try to find the best solution for your school.

## Sensors
 What type of sensors the device works with? Light or ultrasound? Can the signal be disturbed by environmental changes? The curtain in the classroom moves and the light changes in a sunny afternoon and you have to recalibrate. Are there other machines using ultrasound nearby? If yes, one of the machines may end up in the cellar. 

Here is a specific example from welding. An important difference of "cheap" optical motion transmission system: it cannot realize and display the weight loss of the electrode during welding. It only senses that the end of the device is in front of the workpiece, but it cannot simulate the weight loss of the welding material in real time, thus teaching poor movement coordination.â€¦ 

## Lifespan
 What is the reliability and lifespan of the motion tracking system? Needs to recalibrate soon? Goes wrong after a hundred students? Read reviews, ask other customers, negotiate with the producer to guarantee a good service level. Try to be as specific as you can when negotiating service levels such as availability of service, deadlines. The motion tracking system is the soul of the hardware. It might be cheap at the time of buying but may cost lot more afterwards. 

## Integrability
 Now, see the software. Is the simulation automatized enough? In other words, does simulation allow you to learn without a constant engagement of a teacher? The main goal is not only to provide "realistic" visualization, but give a pedagogical structure. Through it, the device itself can teach the correct coordination of movements for the practical application of the skill as quickly and accurately as possible.  Some producers sell yet unexplored solutions, which have serious shortcomings and limitations. One sign of the inexperience is that its use still requires a permanent teacher supervision, which means the complete engagement of the practical instructor while using the simulation. Thus, in case of welding for example, the realisable savings are reduced to only the materials and gases to be used in the training, and the wage cost savings achieved by offloading the instructor cannot be counted. 

Without a **good pedagogical system**, the simulator is useless in vocational training, because just as in the traditional training, the student, if left alone, can develop "bad habits" that are difficult to correct afterwards. 

Some manufacturers do not have a record of how the simulation can be integrated into practical training in either school system or adult training and the extent to which savings can be realized. Thus, the return period of the product cannot be calculated or estimated. 

## Customized to person?
Can the simulation improve concentration skills directly and individually?
Concentration means control of attention. It is the ability to focus the mind on one  subject, object, or thought, and at the same time exclude from the mind every other unrelated thought, ideas, feelings, and sensations. Is the software suitable for measuring users' concentration ability and improving their individualized ability? This is an important aspect of a skilled worker that he can constantly concentrate on what he does. And the development of this ability is very much needed even in school. Ask the manufacturer to show you specifically how the device and its software measure focusing skills. Does it provide systematic training with sessions? Does it show improvement with numbers? Can the software give  personal profiles for individuals in concentration skills development?  

## Knowing the clients
 The last aspect is the human factor. An important selection criterion is also the depth to which the distributor of the product knows the needs of the schools. They supposed to have experience in training. They should have new ideas to support the school in integrating the simulation into practical training, based on their practical experience. The real experts are in daily contact with skill trainers, so they can provide right instructions and information about the effective ways of integrating simulation, even online. 

It is therefore worth examining the existence and clear applicability of the software that performs important analyses for the instructor from the point of view of the management of the training, because any differences will slow down the problem-free synchronization in the virtual environment with the virtual and real practical training. 

These findings were made in the framework of a European project, VIRTWELD, based on a detailed comparison of each solution.
