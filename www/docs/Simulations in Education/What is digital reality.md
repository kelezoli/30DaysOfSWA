Digital reality (DR) is often used as a general term for all type of immersive experiences, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) , mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR). 

In this book Virtual Reality means an immersive computer-simulated reality that creates a physical environment that does not exist. Virtual environments may resemble real places (such as a workshop area or a cockpit of a crane) or imagined ones (the deck of the Titanic for example), they are not in the current physical environment.

Figure 1-1 shows an example of a VR environment. Itâ€™s a screenshot of a professional painting simulator.

On contrast, Augmented reality is a way of viewing the real world and adding extra content ( augmenting) to the real world visual.  The main difference between VR and AR is that AR modify the real visual instead of simulating a visual that do not exist in the current reality. 

Originally, in AR, the computer-generated content is an add on on a separate layer that does not communicate the real world content.  Now, however AR solutions tend to include interaction with the real world objects and this blended solution is often referred as mixed reality (MR). For the sake of simplicity we will refer augmented reality as an umbrella term that cover mixed reality too. 



Figure 1-2 shows an example of AR.

To sum it up, from reality to full immersive virtuality there are 4 different solutions depending on the scale of immersiveness.
