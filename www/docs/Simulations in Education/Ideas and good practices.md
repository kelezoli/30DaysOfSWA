Here you find definitions and links for distance learning, we list here simple but clever solutions to gamify materials, entertain and teach students with help of Digital Reality on a relatively low cost. 

## Distance learning formats
These types of distance learning include:

* **Video conferencing**  Video conferencing is a meeting where participants use video to connect over the internet.  Using tools like Zoom, Blackboard  Collaborate, Adobe Connect, or other conferencing software, teachers and  students interact together no matter where they are located. 
* **Hybrid distance education**   This format combines synchronous and asynchronous methods. Students receive deadlines to complete assignments and exams.  They maintain contact  with their instructor. Yet, they work at their own pace. As students  progress, they gain access to new modules. A DRinVET own method is introduced . Another remarkable example is 
* **Open schedule online courses**   Such courses provide students total freedom. To complete coursework, students receive online textbooks, and other materials. Students are given a set of deadlines. It requires significant  self*discipline and motivation. See an example .
* **Fixedtime online courses**  The most common format for distance learning is "Fixedtime online courses". In this format, students login to the learning site at designated  times. They must complete prescheduled classroom activities at a specific pace. These activities often include chats and discussion forums. Fixed  time online courses encourage student interaction, but thereâ€™s little room for selfpacing.
