# Introduction

You are standing in a glass box with a spray gun. The box gets wider and turns itself a large car industry workspace. After training you do not have to wait until it gets dried. Nor you have to sand the part to repaint again for the next run. 

You are in front of a flat screen following a path with your welding gun and the training tool will follow your hand and measuring the distance, the angles of your hand and the traveling speed of the gun. Before this tool, nobody could improve motor skills so fast and accurately, because  of the lack of instant feedback.


We find ourselves in a rapidly emerging technology field. Virtual Reality headsets, fast and reliable devices do the magic: you feel as if you were there. You could wander about in the ancient Rome, watch birds fly by, stand by a roaring fire and gaze out the windows. The professional audio tying it all together. It feels real.

Moreover, it is precise. Educational simulations are developed to follow very tiny movements of your fingers to proceed medical operations, they teach maneuvering large cargo ships, help memorizing safety protocols, driving vehicles in terrains in deep forests or handling construction cranes even in strong wind at 200 meters from the ground with high fidelity. 

And it is getting cheaper each year.

This is a good news in vocational training. The high tech high precision learning is not a privilege of astronauts anymore.  

## About this handbook

This Handbook on Digital Reality in Vocational Education (DR in VET) is dedicated to teachers, trainers and decision makers in vocational education systems, to help to get familiar with digital reality tools and systems when you plan to implement them. Last but not at least the book is dedicated to the young generation breaking new ways in teaching and learning. 

We wrote this book for you because we'd like to : 

* show you how VR devices can broaden the horizon
* Introduce the wide range of digital reality solutions
* tips on how to choose the most appropriate solution.
* offer tips new ideas to make learning delightful and funny 
* Guidelines for teaching with and implementing digital reality solutions.

## Assumptions

Before we dive into the world of Digital Reality, we should say a few words about reality in vocational education. Some training centers are well equipped and have numerous well trained Digital Instructors. Most of them, however, are far from being aware of the whole range of opportunities digital realities offer. To be realistic, we assume you may work in a school in a mostly centralized educational system with limited influence and resources. We detail [typical situations](#4-obstacles) later on in the chapter four "Obstacles".

We made assumptions about your digital knowledge. We assume that you as a teacher have at least a passing familiarity with Virtual Reality (VR),  Augmented Reality (AR). You may have heard the terms or seen someone trying out a VR experience at a mall or retailer. We assume that you have a certain experience of using learning management software (LMS) such as Moodle, or Google Classroom. You use or are aware of social media such as Facebook or Instagram. You used or saw using videoconferencing tools such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. You are capable to install, run applications on smartphones and personal computers (PCs).  

Also, we have assumptions about your students. Your students may fall into these broad age categories:

* Youngsters (14  to 22 or so)
* Adults who are obliged (or want) to refresh their skills
    They may have very different background coupled with numerous attitudes:
* Lowest social status with no support and lack of motivation. They come because they did not find anything suitable. 
* Low but not very low social status with a remarkable support to break out. Gifted students with help of teachers or parents for example.
* High social status with strong commitment. For example, coming from a traditional crafting or artist family, or,  as an adult, choosing a second career path.  

And uor last assumpitons is that the education or training process usually lasts three years which is taken mainly in a dual system.

## How we organized this book

This is a handbook, planned to look up things in it occasionally.  We list ideas, how-tos, tips and tricks and best practices, hoping that the topics we cover will help you and your students to improve and be happy with their career. We also assume a relevance order on what you may be interested most. That is why topics related to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality got more weight in this book than LMSes and videoconferencing.
