# Lutins bleus

It is an on-line portal assembling all good practices tools and websites that are available for seniors in France. Thanks to Les Lutins Bleus, people can discover and compare all the senior offers on all possible themes: health, home help, housing, technology, mobility, clothing, food, media, leisure, travel, employment, meetings, etc.

The "Silver Economy" is full of offers for seniors and their carers. Finding your way around is sometimes difficult. Indeed, the major players in the market very often rise to the top of the search engine results. At the same time, the smaller players, who do not have the same resources, appear much further down the results. However, they often offer products of just as high quality, and therefore deserve to gain visibility.

The Lutins Bleus are therefore working to identify all the offers on the market and to present them objectively. It is then up to senior or carer, to make the choice according to your own criteria.
