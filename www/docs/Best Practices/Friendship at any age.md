The program "Friendship at any age" concerns lonely and socially excluded people over 65 years old. To implement the program, the Prolepsis Institute collaborated with the French NGO "Petits Fr√®res des Pauvres" (Little Brothers of the Poor), whose sole mission has been to carry out such programs in France since 1946 and internationally with partners from in 1979. 

The beneficiaries are matched with volunteers trained by Prolepsis; the volunteers visit the elderly at home on a weekly basis, and occasionally organize social events outside the home, such as beach visits, walks, free theatrical performances, etc. Volunteers receive psychological support to deal with various issues such as, for example, the death of elderly beneficiaries assigned to them. The Prolepsis Institute also operates a hotline that offers psychological support to lonely seniors without the need for them to participate in the program.
