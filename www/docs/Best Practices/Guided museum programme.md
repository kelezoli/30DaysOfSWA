# Guided museum programme

The donation from Tima Foundation concerns the creation of a program of visits to the Benaki Museum for the elderly. 2,000 elderly members of the Centers for Open Protection of the Elderly from various Municipalities of West Attica will visit the Museum for free within a period of 12 months. Guided tours will be offered to seniors in groups of about 30 people and will also include transportation to and from the Museum and refreshments. As part of the donation, the Museum staff will take part in an interactive simulation training program, to be able to offer better service to the elderly. This innovative training program is based on international best practices and research and is implemented by gerontologists with relevant experience in the field.
