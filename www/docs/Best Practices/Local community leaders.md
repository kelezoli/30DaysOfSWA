# Local community leaders

The topic of this project is the cooperation between experienced community leaders over 50 and possible future ones, making emphasis on the need to rethink and recognize the role of older people and their crucial contributions to the local community. The main objectives of the project are: the encouragement to improve the community development by increasing the number of well- prepared local leaders among people over 50. To reach their objective, project consortium will:

* provide training for current and potential community leaders focused on increasing their knowledge and skills,
* promote the emergence of new community leaders through mentoring,
* encourage local community leaders to share their experiences, best practices as well as active networking.

The project will have two different outputs. The first one, the Handbook and Guide, is focused on how to be a local community leader. The Handbook - will support people over 50 in fulfilling their specific role as local community leaders by building networks between people and institutions, strengthening trust in local community etc.

The Guide - will include different chapters regarding the role of leaders in local community development, using the method of mentoring and will be focused on recommendations for the NGOs and other institutions working at local levels on how to implement the proposed mentoring model. The Training Modules and the Training Kit are focused on providing specific training for local community leaders and will consist of several independent training modules, handouts for trainers, examples of good practices and other useful resources as well as a proposal of the training evaluation. The training modules will be designed to be used as workbooks, self-paced guides, reference manuals, handouts as well as job aids.
