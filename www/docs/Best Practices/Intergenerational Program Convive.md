Link <https://www.comillas.edu/en/social work unit/services/intergenerational program convive living together> 
The program is an intergenerational and supportive initiative based on elderly people, who live alone, and university students living together. The program creates a situation that aims to be enriching for both parties. Beyond the obvious needs taken care of (loneliness of the elderly person and accommodation for the student), it is a mutually enriching intergenerational experience which includes mutual learning and the formation of supportive bonds. The general principles of living together shall be based on: Mutual support. Everyday exchange and dialogue. Respect towards difference. Follow up of the agreements freely made by both parts.
