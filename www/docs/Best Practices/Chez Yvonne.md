“Chez Yvonne” was created in 2019 after a socio-economic opportunity study, commissioned by Moncontour, was conducted. One of the learning points from this study was that the local population, especially the elderly needed support on digital transition issues (e-administration, computer literacy).
The different digital workshops at “Chez Yvonne” are led by volunteers.
They are 3 types of workshops:- “Ecoutes numériques”: intend to help individuals/seniors to make the best use of digital tools (communicating, writing documents, organizing photos, browsing the Internet securely, etc.)-“Ateliers E-Admin”: assist seniors on the use of online administrative services (taxes, medical records, pensions, etc.)
-“Café solidaires numériques” : to learn how to use a computer and discover the newest technology ( 3D printer etc.)
