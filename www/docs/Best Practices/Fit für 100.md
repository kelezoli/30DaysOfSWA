Fit für 100 (Fit for 100) is a physical activity offer for older people which was developed by the German institute of applied sport gerontology located in Köln. Until now, it is offered in more than 50 locations (mainly in North Rhine-Westphalia, NRW). The aims of the physical activity programme is to maintain competencies needed in everyday life, promoting mobility and independence of seniors 60 years old or older (especially 80+) and support their resources and give fall prevention. 

Regarding the demographic changes and the growing number of old and needy people, reaching these goals is of great importance. The programme includes strength exercises as well as coordination exercises. There are alternative exercises for wheelchair users. 

A special feature of the programme is that it is also feasible for dementia patients. The programme should take place twice a week to reach the aims. In order to be allowed to offer the training programme, you have to participate in a certification course which has a duration of three days including 24 teaching units.
Content of the certification course is theoretical and practical knowledge about the exercise programme itself, fall prevention, changes and impairments in older age and typical age-related diseases and how to treat older people and dementia patients in the physical activity group. 

After the certification course two video observations have to be passed to get the certification. This means that the instructor has to film two sessions and a co-worker of the project evaluates it and gives feedback. The training course addresses people working in physiotherapy, sport therapy, nursing-, social- and education service and instructors in seniors‘ exercise groups.

There were many media reports like in journals an in television (Stiftung Warentest, ZDF, ARTE, WDR, 3sat, MDR) about Fit for 100 which raised great interest. Following these reports many people and institutions contacted the Fit for 100-team which shows that people 80+ are motivated to improve their fitness level and life quality
