Learning and participation in later life is crucial for one’s wellbeing, health and engagement. However, older and very old people who are not used to participating and contributing their voices and views are less likely to participate in activities that require some proactive involvement. Invisible talents supports health and social service providers in residential and/or community settings as well as citizens ́ initiatives working with very old people in self-assessing the status-quo of participation and engagement opportunities in their organization and developing concrete actions that make talents visible.
