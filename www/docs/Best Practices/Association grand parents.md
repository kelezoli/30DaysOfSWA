# Association grand parents

To avoid loneliness of the elderly and to support parents when they are isolated, in the absence of grandparents, the Grands-Parrains association strives to recreate the missing intergenerational link. The association puts in contact seniors in age of being grand-parents with children who do not have grand-parents. This relationship is based on trust, exchange and mutual enrichment.

## There are different types of grand-parenting:

**Classical grand-parenting** Spending time with the child from half-days to week-ends, to vacation periods. 

**Great-grand-parenting** For seniors aged from 78 to 85, healthy, living at home or in nursing homes
**Reversed grand-parenting:** the association puts seniors in contact with adult volunteers who have time to share, affection to give and a desire to bring generations together around centres of interest to enrich each other. Activities done together : walks, reading, playing board games , teaching the elderly how to use the new means of communication (telephone, computer), sharing a passionâ€¦
**Epistolary grand-parenting:** it is an opportunity for seniors in nursing homes to exchange anecdotes.
