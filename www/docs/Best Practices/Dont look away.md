# Don't look away programme

The organization “Emphasis” in Greece has designed and applied a program aimed at supporting elderly people living on the streets of Piraeus. These people are unemployed and homeless and the Emfasis team, through street volunteers, social workers and legal advisers, will visit them to offer them "holistic" help according to their needs. Examples of support  from the Emfasis team include: escorting homeless people to hospitals and welfare facilities, and assistance with pending legal issues. The goals of the program are the psychological support of people living on the streets and the provision of incentives to continue their lives. The ultimate goal of the program is to remove the above people from the streets. It is the first program of road interventions that will be addressed exclusively to the elderly homeless in Greece
