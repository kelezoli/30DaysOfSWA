# Wise friends at the museum

"Wise Friends at the Museum" was launched in 2016 with the support of TIMA Foundation and it is addressed to people over the age of 65. Up until today, it has hosted more than 6.000 seniors to the Museum through organized group visits. During the 2017-2018 period, the program was supported by the Young Patrons of the Museum. In 2019 the program is expanded, partnering again with TIMA Foundation and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.

From 2020, the Museum of Cycladic Art offers seniors the opportunity to participate in a guided tour of the museum and to travel for a while across Cyclades via virtual reality glasses.

Based on Seveneleven' s 2018 experience, virtual reality offers a new form of entertainment to those who live with some form of dementia, while, at the same time, according to some researches, the sensory experience it offers, seems to limit symptoms such as stress, anxiety and confusion.

The purpose of the workshops is not only to entertain the seniors who live in caring homes and are not able to visit the Museum, but also to promote their experiential connection with Cycladic culture.
