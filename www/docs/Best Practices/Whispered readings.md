 Whispered readings is an activity/service that some libraries from Barcelona, Spain are offering to older people users that want to participate. How does it work? Each participant can request a maximum of one reading a week. The reading lasts roughly 15 minutes. It is conducted by phone, gradually and in different sessions. A volunteer or a library worker will be assigned to each person using the service. The material offered includes short contemporary texts, stories and noir novels. Users can also request other texts.
