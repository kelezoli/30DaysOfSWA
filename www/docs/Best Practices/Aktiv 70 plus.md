Aktiv 70 Plus is a project of the sports federation in Schleswig- Holstein (federal state in Germany) (LSV) which started in 2008. It is also part of the INFORM initiative. It consists of a special sports programme developed for people aged 70 or more. The programme was evaluated by the institute of sports science of the Christian- Albrechts-University in Kiel. Until now, more than 4000 people participated in 300 courses. If people participate regularly, the costs can (partially) be beared by the insurance companies. 

The aim of the project is to motivate people aged 70+ to participate in a holistic, health-oriented PA offer in the clubs of sports federation (primary prevention). Added to that, the aims are improving strength, endurance, mobility and coordination as well as fall prevention of the participants. 

The course has a duration of 12 weeks and comprises exercise sessions of 60 minutes once a week. The sport instructors at least have to have a license ÜL-C “Seniors”. It can be called a holistic programme because the instructors are also trained by the sports federation in other areas like functional gymnastics, moving with music, awareness training, memory training and relaxation.

 When sport associations want to implement and offer this programme, it should be cost-neutral. That is why there is the possibility of financial support of the clubs/associations in the beginning given by the sports federation (560 Euros per year can be applied for). In the long run, this should lead to enduring, widespread offers. 

More detailed information about the criteria to be financially supported and the application form can be downloaded on the website of the sports federation Schleswig-Holstein. The courses should take place in the near surrounding of the participants so that the participants are more socially integrated. 

The programme was reworked so that it achieved the certification “Sport pro Gesundheit” (German Olympic Sports Federation) and “Deutscher Standard Prävention” (Central Inspection Body for Prevention) in 2020.
