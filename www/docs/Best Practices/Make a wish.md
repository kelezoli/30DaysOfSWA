The "MAKE A WISH - A program for employment of women" project is in accordance with European and national recommendations on improving the position of women on the labour market and protecting women's rights, as well as with the guidelines of the employment policies of EU member states with an emphasis on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, especially due to the fact that the participants of these activities will include women who are in a disadvantageous position on the labour market, and who will take care of the elderly and people in a disadvantaged position.

The project will be implemented by local government and self-government units and associations for a duration of up to 30 months, and is intended for the employment of women in a disadvantaged position on the labour market, with an emphasis on women over 50 years of age, women with completed secondary education at the most, women with disabilities, women victims of human trafficking, treated drug addicts, women victims of domestic violence and homeless women.

Thanks to this project, 15,000 women have been employed in the whole of Croatia so far, working in support and care for the elderly and disadvantaged in their communities. A total of 50,000 people are covered by these projects. Furthermore, projects are implemented in hard-to-reach areas (rural areas and islands) and in those areas where the unemployment rates and long-term unemployment rates are higher than the Croatian average.
