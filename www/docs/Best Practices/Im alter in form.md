# Im alter in form

 

Im Alter IN FORM is a project by BAGSO which is also part of the initiative IN FORM. Its aim is to activate potentials in communes by improving the offers of health prevention concerning older people. They focus on healthy nutrition, physical activity and social participation. Relevant actors (e.g. service providers in the health sector working with seniors like physicians, physiotherapists, pharmacists, nursing homes, fitness centers...) are given information material and offered trainings, symposiums and upgrade training courses on a communal level to advise them how to support a healthy lifestyle in older age. The trainings that are offered are: basic training, advanced training, “IN FORM MitMachBox” (Join in box) in practice, planning and initiating lunch – food on wheels and leading physical activity groups. In symposiums they also inform people in community facilities like nursing homes about how to guarantee a healthy and balanced diet. An example of another type of symposium was in Kassel in 2018. There they talked about the possible contribution of relevant actors in improving and creating health promoting offers and about useful strategies. The advises and information concerning nutrition, physical activity and social participation given in this project are implemented practically in many ways. For example, in Esslingen there were started physical activity groups which meet outdoors regularly and do low level physical activity together with the help of a competent trainer.

Another example is a movement parcours in Hessen which was newly created. It was well accepted by the public and used as a new meeting spot. People using the parcours report more security in everyday life, enjoyment of life and moving capacities. Furthermore, the activities include several research projects like case-studies in 2016 about lunch offers in the communes and the estimated future demand. Another example is an online survey about the status quo of service offers and health promotion measures. Added to this, the website provides information material about the project itself and about the general information concerning the situation of older people
