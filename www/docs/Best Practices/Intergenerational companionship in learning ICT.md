# Intergenerational companionship in learning ICT

**Intergenerational   companionship in learning ICT**   The program Intergenerational companionship in learning ICT is intended   for all older people who would like to learn how to use or improve their  existing ICT knowledge through socializing with young people.  

**How to organize the intergenerational companionship in learning ICT?** 

(Recommendations for organizations wishing to start this kind of   activity)   In the beginning of the school year the organization contacts the high   schools (headmaster, secretary or other person in charge) to find out if they   are interested in such volunteering opportunity for their students. If the answer   is positive, the school appoints a coordinator (usually one of the teachers)   who is responsible to recruit student volunteers, is a contact person for   students and the organization, is in charge of administrative work   (attendance lists etc.) and is available to students for support if needed.   Meanwhile the school coordinator recruits the students, the organization   recruits older people who would like to learn ICT in the company and with   support of younger people. Once the recruitment is completed, both young and   older people undergo a training. 

## **Training program**   

The training consists of three parts:   

1. Training for students (one   meeting, 45 min)   
2. Training for older people   (one meeting, 45 min)   
3. Training for students and   older people together (one meeting, 45  60 min)   

In the training for students, they are encouraged to think about examples   of older people that they admire and to think about what they can learn from   older people. We address the teaching process and some specifics about   working with older people such as speaking slowly and clearly, repeating the   learned information etc.  In the   training with older people, we encourage them to think about their own   childhood and adolescence and what was important at that time (such as autonomy,   peer appreciation, socialization, independence, studies, work etc.) to   prepare them to relate and understand young people. After these two trainings   (which can be held on different days or simultaneously in two different   rooms), the young and old people meet. They introduce themselves, about their   interest, hobbies. By the end of the meeting, they pair up (e.g., based on   shared interests, the level of ICT skills or particular skills that a person   would like to learn; or other aspect). The pairs agree upon the day in the   week, time, and location where they will be meeting during the school year.   It is important that they meet in a neutral place (not at their homes!) but   rather in the school, in the organization’s premises or any other community   place, e.g., public library. The information – pair contact information, day,   time, and location should be given to the school coordinator.  

## **ICT learning through the companionship**   

The previously paired couple of a young and an older person meet once a   week for the whole school year and learn the use of ICT. The learning   curriculum is adapted to the wishes and needs of older people. The role of   older people is to pass on their knowledge and life experiences to young   people through personal conversation. The learning is mutual: older people   learn about advanced use of ICT, thus staying informed, involved, independent   and on the other hand young people get to know and spend some valuable time   with an older person, learning from their life experience.
