# Medicine exchange

GivMed non-profit organization is access to medicines for all. The organization has developed a digital app where users can upload their spare packs of medecins or their needs for them. Then the network of the organization transports the medecins accordingly.

The scopes of the program “We honor. We support. We strengthen.” are:

​     Meeting the pharmaceutical needs of about 800 elderly people, through the network and software of GIVMED in Attica.

​     Awareness and activation of local communities to support geriatric units by donating through GIVMED software the medicines that are no longer needed.

The program runs already 3 years from 2019 and is funded by TIMA Foundation. In 2020-2021 the program has specifically covered pharmaceutical needs of covid-19 (22,250 protective masks, 150,000 gloves, 296 special glasses and 390 liters of antiseptic).
