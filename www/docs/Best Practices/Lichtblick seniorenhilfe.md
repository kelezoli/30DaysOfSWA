# Lichtblick seniorenhilfe

LichtBlick Seniorenhilfe e.V. was established in 2003 and was the first association of this kind in Germany. In sum, there are three LichtBlick teams situated in Munich, Münster and Deggendorf in the Lower Bavaria. The main aim is to support old people with financial difficulties but also to act as spokesman in the general public for them. The association is supported by celebrities that make aware of the situation of old people in Germany in the public, for example Simone Thomalla (actress) or Monica Gruber (carbaret artist). Other partners are for example the Sparda-Bank or Münchener Merkur (newspaper). LichtBlick wants to help old people unbureaucratically, quickly and personally. If someone needs financial help to afford something specific (e.g. new shoes or a new mattress), he or she can fill out an application form for immediate aid. After checking the documents, the application is approved and the money is sent to the applicant.Another option is to apply for a sponsorship that comprises 35 Euros per month which can be spent freely. If someone wants to help and donate money, there are several options. For example, it is possible to give an immediate donation. Here, the amount (from 50 Euros) and interval (from once to monthly) of donation can be chosen by the donator. Another option is to sponsor an old person by donating 35 Euros per month to a single person. Also, it is possible to donate shopping coupons of various values and frequencies. Some seniors shared their life story on the website in which they explain how the help of LichtBlick changed their lives (e.g. [https://seniorenhilfe-lichtblick.de/lichtblick-ist-der-himmel-fuer- mich/ ). Added to that, you can read hand-written letters from the](https://seniorenhilfe-lichtblick.de/lichtblick-ist-der-himmel-fuer-mich/) seniors in which they thank the association. Beyond the financial support, the association also arranges regular activities and events to integrate the seniors into society and to build a community. The seniors can participate without costs. For example, activities on a monthly basis are having a breakfast together, going to the cinema, hiking or to bowl in a group of regulars. In 2019, there were 166 events additional to the regular events even mentioned (e.g. going to concerts or museums). LichtBlick publishes an annual review reporting on the activities and events as well as statistics/ numbers concerning one year. Added to that, it includes personal statements and pictures of the seniors and the staff.Lichtblick seniorenhilfe
