Astroliens offers Place: support to a senior citizen by one (or two) volunteers (young people aged 16 to 25). The volunteers offer computer "lessons" at home. The commitment of the pair is 1 month with 2 sessions per week. The support can then be interrupted or continued. If it continues, the volunteer changes. The average age of the senior citizens is 83 years! They are people who sometimes cannot move (level of autonomy 3 to 6)

Astroliens is involved in the recruitment of volunteers, their training (skills), prepares a programme of courses and above all has developed a board game to better identify the needs of seniors. The courses are of course adapted to the learning pace of the senior citizen. Astroliens offers a follow-up throughout the accompaniment by reviewing the situation with the seniors and the volunteers and supports the young volunteer throughout his or her activity by helping him or her to value the experience. Currently suggesting the activity through Zoom.
