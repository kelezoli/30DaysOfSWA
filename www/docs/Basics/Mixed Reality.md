# Mixed Reality
In 2022 only a few MR devices such as  Microsoft HoloLens and  Magic Leap One and Two are publicly available. Nevertheless, other MR [options exist](https://www.aniwaa.com/buyers-guide/vr-ar/best-mixed-reality-headsets/). Some are not available to consumers (because they are intended for enterprise use) or have not yet been officially launched on the market.
There are already lots of groundbreaking educational apps are available on the market. How do they work? We list four examples to give the idea to use MR in classroom.

Microsoft says: "Effortlessly move and look around your real world to naturally interact with the elements of the tour. Immerse yourself with a unique combination of 360-degree video, spatial sound, and holographic scenery that creates a very real sense of presence: you’ll believe that you’re really there! "
