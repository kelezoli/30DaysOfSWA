# Virtual Reality
![Virtual Surfer](/img/png/virtual_surfer.png)
The most popular field of Virtual Reality (VR) is the gaming world. While there are powerful implementations in Vocational Educations, implementing VR in academic education is a complex challenge - according to the latest analyses of the studies ([^1] , [^2]). Nevertheless,these studies say the ecducational VR field is very new, and quality resources were difficult to find. One thing is certain: virtual vocational education has already had good results - as you can see in the Digital Reality in VET chapter. Here we list positive results and other findings on other education fields to provide you a outlook in 2022. 

## Practical vs. Academic
The learning process has to be interactive, challenging, motivating with quality. There are several models used in implementing such novel technology in the classroom. According to the studies referenced above VR has been widely used as a **practical** learning media. Chemistry teachers, students, peer reviewers, media experts, and material experts have assessed the media in VR learning content and awarded it as useful.

## Radiotherapy

The physics tool VERT (Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training) is a simulation environment to train radiotherapy concepts. Complex concepts such as dosimetry practices are also taught in this method to the trainees rather than clinical environment. VERT also offers blended learning in the classroom. VERT potentially helped the trainees handle the radiotherapy tools (Leong et al., 2018). VERT –  was used in a study and was proven effective because it was used in the classroom without waiting for a patient.

## Chemistry: infrared spectometer

A study was conducted to demonstrate to students the usage of the Infrared spectrometer and its purpose in analyzing the resulting spectrum with Samsung Gear VR's aid under the faculty supervision (Dunnagan et al., 2020). This study's uniqueness is that the VR instructional learning is made available for Google Cardboard and Gear VR with IOS and Android support. An increase in students' motivation to attend labs is found as a result of this study. Students that tried the VR experience reported a high degree of satisfaction with the product and no signiﬁcant usability barriers. These VR experiences could be useful for students who are unable to be present in lab due to disabilities, attendance challenges such as pregnancy, or safety concerns.

## Engagement increased in numerous fields
Study results indicated that the use of VR to teach solar energy shows a significant growth in students' knowledge and engagement. For subjects like organic chemistry, it is reported that the students turned out with a high degree of satisfaction with almost no barriers to using the system.

Google expeditions VR system was introduced to a group of middle school children, and their experiences were accessed using a set of questionnaires. The results showed a significant increase in the group scores that used VR than the traditional instructional method group.

Generally, a study using meta-analyses of other studies [^2] results implies that the integration of both immersive and gamified VR technologies could improve academic achievements and learner performance. Future education could attempt to integrate immersive or gamified VR methods into educational approaches with an aim to facilitating educational efficiency and effectiveness.
