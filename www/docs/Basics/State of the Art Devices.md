### Types of VR Devices 

First you should know the three basic types of the VR Devices.

*   All-In-One *(Also known as Standalone/Wireless)*: A standalone headset doesn’t require a PC or a mobile device to deliver immersive experiences. Just like a laptop, it contains a built-in processor, GPU, screen, sensors, battery, and more.
*   Tethered: A tethered VR headset is connected to an additional device like a PC or a laptop through a wire to showcase the VR experiences.
*   Mobile: A mobile VR headset requires a smartphone to be placed in front of the VR headset to view an immersive content.

Below is the list of the VR headsets based on the most popular producers, their current equipment and potential future Headsets. We do not cover [Microsoft Hololens and Magic Leap](Mixed%20Reality) here, because they are not present in the vocational education market as of 2022 when we write this handbook. 

## HP 

#### HP Reverb G2 (2020) and HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition (May 2021)

Sensory data. Sensational VR.
State-of-the-art sensors capture the state of being Sensors measure muscle movement, gaze, pupil size and pulse and send data to the HP Omnicept platform. By capturing user responses, you can generate insights and adapt experiences.

Breakthrough visuals and sound. Ultimate comfort.
With industry-leading lenses and speakers designed by Valve, high-quality resolution—2160x2160 per eye—and foveated rendering, this HMD delivers lifelike VR like never before. And enjoy a comfortable fit with the adjustable IPD and head strap.
More cameras. Better tracking.
With four cameras built into the headset and no external sensors required, you can now track almost all movement, no matter how extreme. And with a smaller and more ergonomic design, our controllers are natural and comfortable to hold onto.
Safeguarded data. Protected privacy.

Head Mounted Device (HMD) firmware safeguards sensor data at every moment of capture and no data is stored on the headset. HP Omnicept-powered applications help ensure the capture and transfer of data comply with GDPR and keep user data confidential.

## HTC

HTC is at MWC 2022 showing off its latest offerings including Viverse - the company's answer to the metaverse.  Viverse is said to be designed to "empower creativity, collaboration, connection, share experiences and more". It's about connecting people from all walks of life to enjoy new experiences whilst also maintaining identity, security and privacy.

#### HTC VIVE PRO 2 (June 2021) 
One of the examples of the state of the art is the HTC VIVE PRO 2. It has High Resolution AMOLED Screens 
SteamVR™ Base Stations for Professional-GradeTracking Hi-Res Certified™ Headphones

This is a beefed-up upgrade of the first version. The downside is that you still need the tracking stations. This is still one of the “golden” standards for everyday use in different areas (education, entertainment, excursions etc.) However, if you want to precisely track participants/users’ behaviour and attitude for your studies, then Vive Pro Eye could be a better choice.

#### HTC VIVE FLOW (November 2021)
The immersive VR glasses are made for wellness and mindful productivity. Compact and lightweight, the VIVE Flow goes where you go. This is mobile VR equipment, meaning you need to use your phone.

#### HTC VIVE FOCUS (April 2019)
Bridge distance with seamless remote collaboration. Visualize all things creative. Learn and train with unprecedented efficiency. Introducing the all-in-one VIVE Focus 3. Delivering best-in-class graphics, ergonomic comfort and applications that will transform the way you work.
This is also a Controller-Free VR - You can navigate menus with a simple pinch of your fingers. Similarly to the classic HTC Vive, a lot of thought went into this headset. Except now it is wireless and all the tracking is built-in. Every feature is made for enterprise/academic use, including the software. The only issue is the high price tag.

#### HTC VIVE COSMOS ELITE (October 2020)

The HTC Vive Cosmos Elite is an extremely accomplished headset. Not only does it feature excellent build quality and some of the best screens on the market, but it’s also lightweight and despite its lack of portability, it’s one of the favourite headsets on the market. It’s certainly an expensive headset and will require a decent amount of room in order to use it at its full potential, but for its versatility, screen quality and comfort, there are few better on the market.


## Oculus 
Oculus is a division of Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook Inc, that produces virtual reality devices and digital services. They are known for their creation of the best available Virtual Reality HMDs on the market and the only true stand-alone VR currently available on the public consumer marketplace

#### Oculus Quest 2 (October 2020)

Oculus Quest 2 (rebranded as Meta Quest 2 in November 2021) is a virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Reality Labs (formerly Oculus). It is the successor to the company's previous headset, the Oculus Quest. The Quest 2 was unveiled on September 16, 2020, during Facebook Connect 7 Meta Quest 2 makes it simple to meet up with friends—to play ping pong, get in a group workout, build entirely new worlds and so much more.
As an all-around VR headset for a wide range of uses, the Quest 2 is simply unparalleled. The fact is that it's also one of the cheapest reliable VR headsets you can currently get.
 
#### Oculus News    

The Meta Quest Pro is Meta's latest VR headset. Here's what we know: Meta (formerly Facebook) is working on a follow-up to the Oculus Quest 2 (now the Meta Quest 2) that will cost more than the best VR headset and come with advanced sensors curated for the Metaverse. The headset will also support exclusive mixed-reality experiences to justify a higher price tag. Currently, Meta has mapped out its VR hardware plans to deliver a new headset in 2022. Meta Quest Pro is likely to have a Snapdragon chip since Meta just signed on for Qualcomm chipsets for its Quest VR devices.

## Pico

Pico is a Chinese VR company that focuses on providing premium VR products with fine industrial designs. 

#### Pico Neo 3 Pro (May 2021)
The Neo 3 Pro offers improved accuracy and latency experience with the introduction of two new 6DoF controllers that use 32 optical tracking sensors for complex environment positioning. Combined with four wide-angle cameras that bring true millimetre-level positioning and tracking to the headset, stable tracking can be achieved even in low-texture environments with bright or dark settings.
A new user mapping system is both more robust, flexible, and open which allows for a larger range of commercial use-cases without requiring additional devices or setup costs. As VR becomes the default multi-user training, entertainment, collaborative, and social technology these tracking solutions will remove hurdles to effective implementation.

#### Pico G2 4K (May 2019)
If you have high-quality content, the Pico G2 4K is the all-in-one VR headset that will give your target group the best experience. The Pico G2 4K is a standalone virtual reality headset which means no extra equipment is needed. In the all-in-one VR headsets category, Pico G2 4K has the highest resolution (3840 x 2160), leading to a superior viewing experience.
Another big advantage is that the Pico G2 4K runs on an open Android system. This makes it easier to make changes for business use. Examples of this are deactivating buttons, limiting user rights (kiosk mode), and mobile device management. You also do not necessarily have to use the Pico controller. This makes it a handy VR headset for retail setups, events and trade shows. A disadvantage of the headset is that there is still little entertainment content in the Pico Store.

#### Pico News
Pico has an eye on the global VR market
ByteDance has already shown that it knows how to expand in global markets. Its video-sharing app TikTok has become a hallmark among social platforms. The Chinese company wants to tap into the VR market with the Pico brand. Pico is now locally operating in China and sells standalone VR headsets there. Pico 3 is the latest product from the brand that is now available in Europe. However, with Pico 4, the brand might target North America and become a rival to the Meta Quest lineup. 
Meta is currently the leader of the VR market, and Pico can certainly challenge the company with its low-cost products. Meta and Pico’s rivalry in the US will give a boost to the market and might even make other companies like Apple reveal their highly-anticipated VR headsets.

## Playstation VR (October 2016)

Playstation VR are the first virtual reality glasses on the market for game consoles, and since Sony is behind them, they are naturally designed to be used together with the new PS4 game console. In addition to the PS4, you will need the additional products Playstation Camera and either a set of Move Motion Controllers or a PS4 DualShock 4 Controller – depending on what you are going to play.
Playstation VR has included headphones, built-in microphone, gyroscope and accelerometers, and simply needs to be connected to the PS4. As usual with Playstation, it's about user-friendly plug and play, and you don't have to wonder about drivers, software and other complicated things.  

Sony has made a lot out of the design of the glasses. They can be adjusted in many different ways, and the perfect balance and fit means that you don't notice them during use. And that is important. The whole purpose of Playstation VR is precisely to "suck" you into the game, so that you forget everything around you and become part of the virtual world. There are already a number of games available that make use of the exciting new possibilities, and the glasses are also excellent for watching ordinary movies in "large format".

###### Playstation VR 2 - 2023?

Sony’s second PSVR headset promises a huge leap forward over the original PlayStation VR. Not only will the PSVR 2 take advantage of the PS5's more powerful hardware, it has a significantly higher resolution display for each eye as well. Faster refresh rates, a wider field of view, and improved tracking and input have also been confirmed. 
PSVR 2 specs rumors previously indicated that the headset will include an OLED display that boasts a total resolution of 4000 X 2040 pixels - that’s 2000 X 2040 per eye and just slightly more than the Oculus Quest 2.
Sony has confirmed that the PSVR 2 does indeed offers 4K HDR, a 110-degree field of view, foveated rendering, and frame rates of 90/120Hz. PSVR 2 also includes inside-out tracking, which means it'll track you and your controller through integrated cameras embedded in the headset. Your movements and the direction you look will be reflected in-game, without the need for an external camera.
The new sensory features of PSVR 2 combine eye tracking, headset feedback, 3D Audio, and the PSVR 2 Sense controller to create a deeper feeling of immersion. A single built-in motor in the headset will add an additional tactile element, which can replicate the player's pulse during tense moments, or the rush of objects passing by a player's head.
Eye tracking will be a particularly pleasing addition for VR enthusiasts, which lets PSVR 2 track the motion of your eyes. Simply look in a specific direction and the headset will create an additional input for your game character. This results in a more intuitive and natural experience. 

 
## Valve Index (2019)
Valve has played a huge and important part in pushing virtual reality forwards over the years with its tracking system and SteamVR platform. But it didn’t launch its own VR headset until 2019, the Valve Index. 
Even today, nearly two years after it launched, the Valve Index is one of the best virtual reality headsets money can buy. It has an ultra-crisp display that runs fairly well even with older GPUs, a wide field of view, a high refresh rate and Valve’s 'knuckle' controllers, which can track the movement of each and everyone one of your fingers.

A Valve Index 2 is the likely next iteration from the iconic VR headset, but much like the PS5 Pro or Xbox Elite Series 3 controller, while it could be likely, they are not confirmed just yet.

Valve Index 2 Release Date
No one officially knows the release date Valve has in mind for the Valve Index 2 (Project Deckard), nor do we have reliable rumours we can go off. The best we can guesstimate is based on three factors: (1) the cyclical time between headset announcements, (2) supply chain bottlenecks caused by Covid, and (3) Steam’s focus on the Steamdeck.

## VARJO

Varjo Technologies Oy, commonly referred to as Varjo, is a Finnish manufacturer of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality headsets. The company was founded in 2016 by former Nokia and Microsoft executives. Varjo specializes in developing high-resolution devices that offer clarity comparable to the human eye. 

The company's first head-mounted display, Varjo VR-1, was launched in February 2019, and it was followed by Varjo VR-2 and VR-2 Pro models in October 2019. Varjo's first mixed reality device, Varjo XR-1 Developer Edition, was released to the market in December 2019. The third-generation products, Varjo XR-3 and VR-3 were launched in December 2020. The fourth-generation consumer product Varjo Aero was released to the market in 2021. Varjo has raised over $100 million in venture capital funding to date.

#### Varjo XR-3 (2021)

Varjo XR-3 delivers the most immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed, featuring photorealistic visual fidelity across the widest field of view of any XR headset. And with depth awareness, real and virtual elements blend together naturally.
The world’s only human-eye resolution (over 70 PPD) mixed reality headset with the widest field of view (115 degrees) guarantees the most naturally immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed.
With precise and individually calibrated colours for unmatched realism, the Varjo XR-3 sets a new industry standard for visual fidelity across realities. Photorealistic, true-to-life mixed reality powered by low-latency, 12-megapixel video pass-through. The industry’s highest resolution (over 70 ppd) and the widest field of view (115°). The widest-ever colour gamut matches 99% with sRGB and 93% with DCI-P3 colour space for the most realistic scenes ever produced. 
According to their website, "If you need the best, then look no further. These are the same headsets astronauts use to train before going to space. They’re amazing in every way, but they will cost you and you need to be tethered to a computer."

#### Varjo Aero (2021)
Varjo Aero offers a generational leap in visual fidelity for professionals and leading-edge VR users alike.
With a future-proofed optical design and stunning dual mini-LED displays, Aero is the lightest & brightest VR headset available for both professional and recreational use. The Varjo Aero features a cutting-edge optical design that propels users to a new level of visual fidelity, pushing the pixels tighter together directly in front of you. The variable resolution lenses create an ultra-sharp peak resolution of 35 PPD, right at the centre of focus where it matters most – mimicking the way the human eye works. Alternative commercially available headsets max out closer to 20 PPD.
Compared to the murky experience of consumer-grade Fresnel lenses, the lenses in the Aero are aspheric, offering an incredible true-to-life visual experience that makes god rays and the screen-door effect a thing of the past.
