AR is often adopted to help students with complicated subjects. For example, in subjects requiring high spatial ability AR can play important role. Another application of augmented reality in education includes  teaching global perspectives through virtual field trips. 
Augmented Reality has been used for about a decade to support teaching-learning processes. Traditional methodologies are increasingly taking a back seat and new didactic and pedagogical proposals are becoming more relevant, among them we find, in addition to some better known ones such as flipped learning, Project Based Learning or gamification, we also find that currently new technologies are being given greater prominence, among which we find AR and VR.
In this sense, some institutions and companies saw the importance of emphasizing and promoting the use of these tools in the teaching of manual trades such as welding or construction. The possibility of learning and practicing in a simulated digital space has as a consequence, above all, the avoidance of risks to health and physical integrity, as well as the reduction of the use of resources that are going to be discarded or are highly polluting.


## Benefits of AR

AR can have a significant impact on learning environments. Student interest soars with the opportunity to creating content. AR technologies can allow them to add to valuable content, create virtual worlds. Classes that exploits AR  can help students become more involved and collaborate. 

AR can help memorize complicated processes. For example, instead of just presenting photographs on a projector showcasing typical mistakes in creating an artifact, a teacher can use AR technology to make memorable connections that lead to failure or success. Moreover, AR technology helps teachers create lesson plans with experiences. Students  can carry out physical activities instead  of watching a demonstration. This approach can help with sensory  development.

## AR Tools
### Assemblr

![an image will come here](/img/png/assmblr_std.png)

The [Assemblr Studio](https://assemblrworld.com/studio)  is an app that you use via your computer's web browser. The 3D library is  notable with animated objects and many educational items to include in  your class. The platform is simple to use, and it allows more  personalizations than many of the other tools. The free options are  acceptable for many classrooms, and the cost to upload a customized  trigger image (also called marker) is affordable. View my AR experience  using the Assemblr app by scanning it.

## Further information

* If you want to develop simple games or interactive apps it is good to begin with an instructable at https://www.instructables.com/Augmented-Reality-Tutorial-for-Beginners-With-Vufo/
This tutorial shows you how to make an augmented reality app in Unity 3D with Vuforia. The game is an interactive ball maze that can be built to Android or IOS. It utilizes the front facing camera to track an image target. This video also goes through how to build the app for Google Cardboard so the game can be played with virtual reality headsets.
* If you want to learn how to make 3 dimensional (3D) models, see https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-your-first-3D-model/ This tutorial will introduce Google Sketchup, an easy to use modelling software to you.
* If you want to go into details or just want to know all the terms and relations in 3D modelling [this guide from the gaming world](https://game-ace.com/blog/3d-modeling-for-unity/) is warmly recommended.  
* In case you want to learn to design games or interactive simulations, try [Unitiy](https://unity.com/) a software designed to create 2D and 3D games. According to [the relating wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)) it is free for personal use and companies with a relatively small yearly revenue.
