| **Name of the Exercise**     | **The Green Paper of demographic    changes**                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of   participants** | 5-10                                                         |
| **Duration**                 | 90 minutes                                                   |

| **How to conduct it**        | **Review - 15 minutes** After introducing the objective   Break the group into 2-3 persons subgroups. Hand each group the contents and   the introduction of the Green Paper, AND only a part of the 24 page document,   that would make sense to read and process in a subgroup (e.g. Meeting the   growing needs of an ageing population"Meeting the health and long-term   care needs of an ageing population" parts to one group, and other titles   to other group and so on. Ask   each subgroup to review their part and form 2-3 questions based on the material   they reviewed. For example "What is the possible impact of the cross   border mobilty of healthcare staff on ageing problems in our country?"   They should write their questions at flipchart size, and post them on the   wall **Understanding answering all the   questions - 5 minutes** After   gathering the questions and posting them on the wall, run a short plenary to   get a common ground: whether each of the participants understands the   questions based on the materials. The trainer should facilitate this process.   Important note. This is not the discussion part! It is just a part when the   facilitator let the participants explain what they understood of their parts,   and understand the questions and the relvevance formed by other groups. **Discussion** - 40 minutes Then the participants try to   find answers and relevance to the questions. This is a plenary session too.   They may decide to follow the order they see on the wall, or they may choose   another arrangement to answer the questions or may find other relevant topics   they may address. The facilitator actively listens and makes notes on the   flipchart or in a laptop projected on the wall too. **Closing 10 minutes** At the end, each particpants one   by one should answer what benefits they gained in this workshop. |
| **Closing remarks**          | the results are the   statements, the topics, and perhaps some kind of order of topics based on   relevance. |
