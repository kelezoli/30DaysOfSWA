There are common misconceptions about VR technology that may hold organizations back. 

The common virtual reality training myths include:

* Simulators are just games
* Virtual reality training doesn’t actually improve learning because it distracts learners
* Virtual Simulators are only for the rich
* Simulators are for entry level education only
* Simulators substitute real trainings
* Having only one simulator makes no sense


## Myth 1: Simulators are just games
They are imperfect and basic. They are good for entertainment only. Aviation is an exception of course, but generally they are not for VET professional education.
### Fact:
There are numerous examples listed in the previous chapters and in [Showcase](../../showcase) to debunk this myth.

## Myth 2: Virtual Reality training doesn’t actually improve learning because it distracts learners
A frequently called critique of VR technology is that it distracts learners more than it engages them. VR training is actually less distracting and improves skills more effectively than a traditional classroom learning environment. 
### Fact:
* Enhances engagement levels through interactive, safe learning activities
* Builds muscle memory through hands-on, realistic learning activities
* Headsets allow employees to focus solely on their VR environment without real-world distractions

In [one research](https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/2140), trainees trained with VR showed better knowledge acquisition, retention, and engagement rates than those who learned from a textbook or video.  

## Myth 3: Simulators are only for the rich
They are too expensive and it is a symbol of status such as a fancy car, but a good old car can take you everhwhere so do the old and well proven classroom methods.
### Fact:
VR is a cost-effective, scalable training solution despite the popular myth that this technology is not available for smaller buyers. In fact cost of a VR training program can range anywhere from Eure 20,000 to Euro 150,000 or more, depending on the needs. 

VR training is actually cheaper than traditional programs, especially if used at scale. Once a VR program is created, organizations can re-use their content and hardware on an as-needed basis, reducing repeat costs. There are also several ways to mitigate VR training costs, from using cardboard headsets to utilizing existing internal resources at an organization. 

## Myth 4: Simulators are for entry level education only
They are good to show the profession on a recruitment day in a school or at a fair. They may be good for classroom demonstration and learn some basic skills, but soon after you should go back to reality.
### Fact:
In 2016 and 2018 two young Hungarian welders won the bronze medals on a high standard welding competition in [Euroskills Göteborg](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj7vNS2tMX7AhUZ6CoKHfT5BSQQFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.wko.at%2Fnews%2Foesterreich%2Feuroskills_2016_award_winners.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3AyQDIOeOvcbi-9kUYLDJU) and in [Euroskills Budapest](https://www.bme.hu/news/20181025/BMEs_success_at_the_European_Championship_of_young_professionals?language=en). In the trainings simulators were used during the whole preparation phase. Initially, the simulators were used to form skills, later simulators were employed to detect key points in long tasks where competitors were got tired and loose focus. Sometimes simulators were used against boredom of monotonous tasks.

## Myth 5: Simulators substitute real trainings
You can also hear positive myths about VR. The old fashioned and costly machines can go to the storage or can be sold out and only a few can remain for examination and demonstration purposes.
### Fact:
Simulators never substitute real environment, tools and people. They complement them where using simulators are has extra benefits. In welding for example psychomotor skills can be developed without using real steel pieces. The VR makes education much cheaper and quicker.

## Myth 6: Having only one simulator makes no sense
Basically, simulators are okay in VET, but we have budget only for one machine but we have twenty-more students in the classroom. Shall I need 20 machines for each of them?
### Fact:
Even with only one AR/VR simulator can serve a bunch of people in the classroom if you can organize the students. With well planned learning scenarios you can rotate the students on different subjects.
