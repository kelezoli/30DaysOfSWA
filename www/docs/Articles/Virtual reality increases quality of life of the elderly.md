# Virtual reality increases quality of life of the elderly

"Any activity that promotes curiosity, critical thinking, and meaningful social engagement is good for the brain's health and fitness. Virtual reality's ability to give users a sense of presence by stimulating the visual, auditory, and vestibular systems allows them to experience new and remembered—or forgotten—experiences like never before,"  Aaron Tate, Director of Emerging Technologies at the University of Texas at Dallas's Center for Brain Health.

The quality of life of older people is a very important factor for a stable and beautiful third age. In 2019, Van Leeuwen KM et al. characterized it through 9 domains: health, autonomy, activity, relationships, adjustment, emotional comfort, spirituality, home and neighbourhood, and financial security. In an effort to achieve a higher quality of life, the question is how to establish a correlation between older people on the one hand and the dynamics of today's life and the rapid development of technology on the other?

Older people, realistically, lose certain abilities with each subsequent year of life and their social environment naturally decreases. If this is added to the two-year isolation of the elderly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, then the problem becomes even more complex. Social isolation favours the faster development of characteristic diseases of older people, such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, but according to some research, it also increases the possibility of heart attack and stroke by about 30%.

We all know that the mental and physical activity of older people has no alternatives and that only health problems can limit them. Research conducted at the University of Texas at Dallas's Center for Brain Health showed that virtual reality technology has a great potential for encouraging the aforementioned activities, with the fact that this also applies to those people who have certain health problems. This research was the trigger for many companies (one of them is MyndVR) to go into the field of development and application of virtual reality for people primarily placed in retirement homes.

There are many examples, which can be found on social networks, that show that these activities make sense, that this is the future for raising the level of quality of life, although in order to get that confirmation, it needs to be proven through research that is still ongoing. Virtual reality can allow users to realize all their wishes related to the past and the future.

Swimming with dolphins, diving, driving an airplane, jumping with a parachute, flying into space, visiting a museum on the other side of the world, walking down your street, visiting your home and feeling that this is reality is made possible by immersive virtual reality. All these activities, fulfilling the wishes of users with virtual reality, have an impact on stimulating mental and physical activities, encouraging positive emotions and relaxation, which has a direct impact on the quality of life of older people.
Some of the data from the surveys in which the elderly spoke about their own experience, which are not fully confirmed by research, show that their experience was extremely good, and 100 percent said that they enjoyed the experience. The majority said virtual reality had a positive effect on their mental health, with 96 percent saying it helped them feel happier, 97 percent felt more relaxed, 98 percent more positive and 94 percent less anxious.

With personal experience in practicing skills using virtual simulators, I believe that the results will realistically be better than any predicted. This is supported by the fact that, as expected, by 2025 the total revenue in the virtual reality market for older people is to increase by 3.5 times from 6.1 to 21 billion dollars. It is also expected that with this increase, the prices of VR will become more acceptable for a larger number of older people.

Interesting, isn't it?
