Definition of ageism – treating   a person less favorably than others because of his or her chronological age. Ageism is stereotyping   and/or discrimination against individuals or groups based on their age. This   may be casual or systemic. Originally it was identified chiefly towards older   people, old age, and the ageing process; discriminatory practices against  older people; and institutional practices and policies that cause stereotypes   about older people.    

Ageism usually refers to negative discriminatory practices against old   people, people in their middle years, teenagers, and children.   

Ageism can operate both   consciously (explicitly) and unconsciously (implicitly), and it can be   expressed at three different levels: microlevel (individual), mesolevel   (social networks) and macrolevel (institutional and cultural).  

Ageism arises when age   is used to categorize and divide people in ways that lead to harm,   disadvantage and injustice and erode solidarity across generations.

Ageism refers to the **stereotypes**   (how we think), **prejudice** (how we feel) and **discrimination** (how   we act) directed towards people on the basis of their age.   It can be **institutional**,   **interpersonal** or **selfdirected**.    Institutional ageism refers to the laws,   rules, social norms, policies and practices of institutions that unfairly   restrict opportunities and systematically disadvantage individuals because of   their age.   Interpersonal ageism arises in   interactions between two or more individuals, while selfdirected ageism   occurs when ageism is internalized and turned against oneself. 

**Ageism starts in childhood and   is reinforced over time.** From an early age, children pick up cues from those around them about   their culture’s stereotypes and prejudices, which are soon internalized.   People then use these stereotypes to make inferences and to guide their   feelings and behaviour towards people of different ages and towards   themselves.      

**Some examples of ageism in daily are:**  

 • Praising older people by   comparing them to younger ones: "You look good for [your age],"   "You're young at heart" or "Inside, I feel 30 years   younger."   

•   "You're still... [dancing,   driving, going to the gym, wearing a particular style]" or "You're   too old to do those things."   

• Describing minor forgetfulness   as a "senior moment."   

• Health care and socialservice   providers who patronize older people, or who undertreat, overtreat or   overmedicate them.   

• Patronizing language (sweetie,   dear, honey, he's so sweet, isn't she cute). Thinking older people doing   things associated with younger people (mild cursing, having or referring to sex)   is adorable or surprising.       

• Namecalling: geezer, gramps, old fart, dirty old man, little old lady, old bag, biddy, old fogey.      

• Lying about your age for fear   of negative perceptions, or staying "39" year after year.   

• Assuming that young people are   computer geniuses and older people are technologically inept.   

• Discussions of the "silver   tsunami" that blame older people for economic and social challenges. 

• Loosing a job because of your age   

• being refused interestfree   credit, a new credit card, car insurance or travel insurance because of your   age   

•  receiving a lower quality of   service in a shop or restaurant because of the organisation’s attitude to   older peo
