# Green Paper on Aging

 GREEN PAPER ON AGING Fostering solidarity and responsibility between generations
 The purpose of this green paper is to launch a **broad policy debate on ageing** to discuss options on how to anticipate and respond to the challenges and opportunities it brings, notably taking into account the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and UN Decade for Healthy Ageing. Competences for dealing with the effects of ageing are largely in the hands of Member States and the EU is well placed to identify key issues and trends and support action on ageing at national, regional and local level. It can help Member States and regions develop their own, tailor-made policy responses to ageing.
