# In-group social learning

**In-group social learning** is a group method used for development of good and quality habits among different groups of adults. It's additional value is in bridging  the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. The method was developed by prof. Jože Ramovš, the founder of Anton Trstenjak 
Institute, and his team. It is based on learning from shared experience and combines gerontological knowledge on aging, anthropological knowledge on intergenerational relations strengthening, psychological 
knowledge on importance of experience sharing, neurological knowledge on reinforcement of learning process and andragogical knowledge on adult learning principles. The method is carried out in groups of around 10 older persons among which there are two volunteers – multipliers, who have been educated in the group formation, leadership and have knowledge on how to implement a specific thematic program. During the last 20 years, more than 700 hundred volunteers have been trained in this method across Slovenia and Croatia, resulting in some hundreds of groups for quality ageing.
