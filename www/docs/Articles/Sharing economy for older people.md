# Sharing economy for older people

## What is sharing economy?

 The sharing or   collaborative economy is a business model based on the sharing of underused   goods or services, free of charge or for an agreed compensation. It comprises   all the activities that suppose a sharing of goods or services between   individuals with the main objective to achieve the most efficient use of the   available resources.    This model involves   the temporary consumption or use of goods that are usually underutilized or have   not been monetized yet and differs from the traditional model based on   hyper-consumption and permanent acquisition and ownership of goods. 

Sharing rather than owning helps people to save money, increase social capital,   improve community, meet new people, build trust and lower carbon footprints.   It is sustainable alternative to the traditional market model.   It is facilitated by   digital platforms, as a link between suppliers and consumers, thus   eliminating the role of intermediaries and consequently enabling savings as   well as the trust factor. Collaborative consumption includes both tangible   and intangible assets from almost all areas such as transport, accommodation,   working infrastructures, leisure, clothing, etc.The 2008 economic crisis and   the growth of digital technologies led to the development of sharing economy   initiatives; individuals were looking for additional savings and income and   therefore offered their goods or services on sharing economy platforms.  

## **The European   Commission about sharing economy** 

  As the collaborative   or sharing economy is rapidly developing in Europe, the European Commission   has been working on the understanding of this phenomenon and better   regulation of its features. The Commission defines collaborative or sharing   economy as business models meeting the following criteria:[[1\]](#_ftn1)   

- Business   transactions take place between three parties – the service provider, the   online platform and the customer
- Service providers   offer access to their goods, services or resources on a temporary basis.
- The goods,  services or resources offered by the service provider are otherwise unused. 
- The goods,   services and resources are offered with or without compensation (i.e. for   profit or nonprofit/sharing).  

## **Benefits for older people** 

Sharing economy platforms enable communication among people and   interaction with the environment, exchanging knowledge and experiences, exercising learning   capabilities, civic and public participation, and involvement in new forms of   leisure and entertainment.   Sharing economy brings benefits to all generations. Focusing on the   seniors, it could improve or make many daily routines and tasks easier. For   example: carpooling where the application connects drivers and passengers   with the same destination. This can be very useful for seniors who need a   ride because public transport is not provided or connections are poor; on the   other hand, this can be an opportunity for them to meet new people and   broaden their social network.   One of the benefits of the sharing economy is ﬁnancial, as goods and   services provided by sharing economy platforms are usually cheaper and more   accessible than traditional ones.   Seniors are empowered by the feeling of belonging to a community: the   sharing economy is driven by its community and based on trust and   collaboration between its users and providers. The whole society, including   seniors can benefit from the use of platforms. The challenge is to promote   their advantages to seniors and encourage them to use them. 

## **Challenges for older people**  

 Main challenges are attitudes and habits based on existing market models   and consumers’ society: owning rather than sharing, individual rather than   community etc. Other challenges seniors find are those referred to their   physical condition (commonly hearing, visibility or motor skills problems),   the lack of formation about it or the belief that it is too complex, the   reduced economic capacity and the socalled ‘technological anxiety’. However, the anxiety and fear of ICT is a common reaction also in other age periods[[2\]](#_ftn2).
