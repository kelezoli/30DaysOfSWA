# New technology in care: opportunity or threat to older people’s rights? 

This article discusses that even if the digital technologies can be used to improve social care, they can also negatively affect human rights and contribute to the segregation and isolation of older people. 

**How to ensure a future where technology is used to advance human rights, not threaten them?** 

To ensure the right path, we need a rights based approach in care, taking the needs and interest of older people in their diversity. Technologies in care should not be used as ways to cut back cost, cut staff, services, etc., and lead to the loss of individual privacy and independence. To avoid that, we need careful monitoring and make sure the provision of care is *“back into the hand of the citizens”,* highlighted the researchers. It should be “**made by us, not for us**”. 

This rights based approach means:

- addressing **digital divide**: tackling affordability and accessibility, 
- ensuring autonomy and **self determination**: people should have the control and choice over how they want to live their life, 
- ensuring meaningful **consent**. This requires real transparency by designers and providers on purpose and risks, the right and possibility for users to change their minds and completely reject technologies in the care sector, without any adverse resistance, 
- defining “**red lines**” for technology using Artificial Intelligence: we need to identify which technologies should not be used in the context of care as they will violate human rights, 
- assessing impact, 
- **involving** older people directly in the design, development and implementation of the decisions to ensure the diverse needs and interest of older people are taken in account. This process should be monitored by older people themselves. Technology is a tool that should aim to optimize the potential of older people and respect their self determination and use the technologies that are available but be sure that it is in our benefits and not in our disadvantages.
