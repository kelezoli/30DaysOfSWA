# Netiquette

**Netiquette**  is a set of unofficial rules for good behaviour and politeness for users   of online and digital technologies such as the Internet, email, chat rooms   etc.  Here are some guidelines and tips about “do's and don'ts” for mobile phone   and email communication, for discussion groups, forums, and social media.

## **Mobile phone etiquette in public areas** 

Talking or texting on a mobile phone in public may be a distraction or a   barrier for socialization. In the past years, society has become less   tolerant of mobile phone use in public areas  public transportation,   restaurants etc.   Mobile phone use can be an important sign of social discourtesy, such as   phones ringing during meetings, classes, funerals or weddings, in cinemas   etc. In certain places their use is prohibited, not to disturb other people.   Some trains, particularly longdistance services, offer a "quiet   carriage" where phone use is prohibited. 

Phubbing means ignoring one’s companion or companions in order to pay attention to one’s phone or another mobile device. Don’t phub your friends!

## **Etiquette for writing and sending email** 

- **Keep your email short**    It is better to keep your emails short and to the point, focus only on one   subject (other subject in separate email). 
- **Read again before sending**    Before sending take the time to review your email to prevent the embarrassing   situations: sending to the wrong recipient, failure to include attachments,   correct errors in spelling and grammar. Once you click “send”, there is no   return.
- **Use “reply all” only when needed**    If you do “reply all” make sure the email is relevant to the entire group. It   can generate a lot of email replies which junks up everyone’s inbox. 
- **Use CC and BCC properly**    Carbon copy (or CC) sends a copy of your message to this recipient and blind   carbon copy (or BCC) will send a copy to the third party but without the   other recipients being able to see that. When sending an email to a group of   people use BCC in order to keep the email addresses private. 
- **Use good email subject lines**    The subject line is the first item the recipient will see  what your email   is about and what needs to be done. It will also help the recipient   prioritize emails. 
- **Respond promptly to emails** It is common courtesy to acknowledge the receipt of an email, at least within 24 hours. Even if you cannot respond to it right away, the sender should at least receive an answer that you have read it and you will get back to it as soon as possible. 
- **Inform recipient of attachments** You can include attachments to emails documents or images. If the files are large, taking up a lot of memory, you may have to send multiple files or compress them or open a file in DropBox, Google Drive or another filesharing platform and send a link to the recipient. 
- **Use capital letters carefully** It is understood that writing emails in capital letters is equivalent to shouting and it’s rude. To emphasize a word or a phrase it is recommended to use bold type font or italics or underlining. 
- **Do not forward chain letters** This will make you look unprofessional whether it is jokes, photos or chain emails. 
- **Etiquette for online discussion groups, forums and in social media etc.** Many sites have descriptions of rules of good behaviour, usually as the terms and conditions you must agree to when you open your account. You might as well check if the site has a FAQ (frequently asked questions) section, which include questions that have been asked and answered many times.
  **Basic rules are**: Even though you may express strong disagreement with what somebody, calling them names or threatening is not acceptable. Do not spam post advertisements for products or services. Use clear and simple language to avoid misunderstandings. Slang is not recommended. Do not forget that your posts are public and can be read by everybody. Stay ontopic. If you need technical help, do not ask questions you could answer yourself by reading the manual or online help. Do not post copyrighted materials.
